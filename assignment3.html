                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>It is clear that Action and PS2 has the highest global sales compared to other genres or platforms respectively. One interesting thing that can be observed is that while the difference between global sales of each genre is mostly gradual throughout, the same cannot be said for platforms. Specifically, some platforms, including PS2, X360, PS3, Wii, DS, and PS, have significantly higher global sales compared to other platforms.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Both graphs show very similar trends for genres and platforms. Specifically, There is a stark increase in global sales approximately in 1990 for genre and 1995 for platforms, which is roughly at the same time. For the genres, the peaks are between 2000 and 2010 with action and sport peaks significantly higher than others. For the platforms the peaks are between 2000 and 2005, which is also around the same time as the genre. It is clear that PS2 has the highest peak, but the difference between the peak are more gradual unlike the genres. The global sales then declines sharply in 2015 for genres and between 2010 and 2015 for platforms.</p>
